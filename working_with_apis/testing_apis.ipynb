      "BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GB), a grade 4 glioma is the most common primary \n",
      "malignant brain tumor in adults. Recently, the mutation status of isocitrate \n",
      "dehydrogenase (IDH) has been crucial in the treatment of GB. IDH mutant cases \n",
      "display a more favorable prognosis than IDH-wild type ones. The anaplastic \n",
      "lymphoma kinase (ALK) is expressed as a receptor tyrosine kinase in both the \n",
      "developing central and peripheral nervous systems. Increasing lines of evidence \n",
      "suggest that ALK is over-expressed in GB and represents a potential therapeutic \n",
      "target.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The goal of the current study was to investigate ALK-1 \n",
      "immunohistochemical expression in gliomas, grade 4, besides its correlation with \n",
      "IDH1-R132H mutation status and the clinicopathological parameters of the tumors.\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy cases of gliomas, grade 4 were tested for \n",
      "immunohistochemical expression of ALK-1 & IDH1-R132H in the tumor cells.\n",
      "RESULTS: ALK-1 immunoexpression was detected in 22.9% of our cases and \n",
      "IDH1-R132H mutation was detected in 12.9% of them. ALK-1 expression (100%) was \n",
      "only detected in the more aggressive IDH R132H-negative GBs. ALK-1 expression \n",
      "was also noted in the larger-sized tumors, more in males and patients older than \n",
      "the mean age.  Conclusion: Our results suggest that mutations in ALK-1 may \n",
      "predict a more dismal prognosis since ALK expression was only noted in IDH-R132H \n",
      "negative GBs known to have a considerably poorer outcome compared to IDH-R132H \n",
      "mutant cases. GBs with detectable ALK-protein expression could potentially \n",
      "experience substantial clinical advantages through the utilization of newly \n",
      "introduced ALK inhibitors allowing personalized treatment to a subset of \n",
      "patients. Hence, future studies targeting ALK in IDH wildtype Glioblastomas \n",

      "Background: Brain metastases (BMs) is one of the most frequent metastatic sites \n",
      "for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is a matter of debate whether EGFR \n",
      "mutation in the primary tumor may be a marker for the disease course, prognosis, \n",
      "and diagnostic imaging of BMs, comparable to that described for primary brain \n",
      "tumors, such as glioblastoma (GB). This issue was investigated in the present \n",
      "research manuscript. Methods: We performed a retrospective study to identify the \n",
      "relevance of EGFR mutations and prognostic factors for diagnostic imaging, \n",
      "survival, and disease course within a cohort of patients affected by NSCLC-BMs. \n",
      "Imaging was carried out using MRI at various time intervals. The disease course \n",
      "was assessed using a neurological exam carried out at three-month intervals. The \n",
      "survival was expressed from surgical intervention. Results: The patient cohort \n",
      "consisted of 81 patients. The overall survival of the cohort was 15 ± 1.7 \n",
      "months. EGFR mutation and ALK expression did not differ significantly for age, \n",
      "gender, and gross morphology of the BM. Contrariwise, the EGFR mutation was \n",
      "significantly associated with MRI concerning the occurrence of greater tumor \n",
      "(22.38 ± 21.35 cm3 versus 7.68 ± 6.44 cm3, p = 0.046) and edema volume (72.44 ± \n",
      "60.71 cm3 versus 31.92 cm3, p = 0.028). In turn, the occurrence of MRI \n",
      "abnormalities was related to neurological symptoms assessed using the Karnofsky \n",
      "performance status and mostly depended on tumor-related edema (p = 0.048). \n",
      "However, the highest significant correlation was observed between EGFR mutation \n",
      "and the occurrence of seizures as the clinical onset of the neoplasm (p = \n",
      "0.004). Conclusions: The presence of EGFR mutations significantly correlates \n",
      "with greater edema and mostly a higher seizure incidence of BMs from NSCLC. In \n",
      "contrast, EGFR mutations do not affect the patient's survival, the disease \n",

      "PURPOSE: Gene fusions involving receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) define an \n",
      "important class of genomic alterations with many successful targeted therapies \n",
      "now approved for ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK gene fusions. Fusions involving the \n",
      "ERBB family of RTKs have been sporadically reported, but their frequency has not \n",
      "yet been comprehensively analyzed and functional characterization is lacking on \n",
      "many types of ERBB fusions.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed tumor samples submitted to Caris Life \n",
      "Sciences (n=64,354), as well as the TCGA (n=10,967), MSK IMPACT (n=10,945) and \n",
      "AACR GENIE (n=96,324) databases for evidence of EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB4 gene \n",
      "fusions. We also expressed several novel fusions in cancer cell lines and \n",
      "analyzed their response to EGFR and HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\n",
      "RESULTS: In total, we identified 1,251 ERBB family fusions, representing an \n",
      "incidence of approximately 0.7% across all cancer types. EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB4 \n",
      "fusions were most frequently found in glioblastoma, breast cancer and ovarian \n",
      "cancer, respectively. We modeled two novel types of EGFR and ERBB2 fusions, one \n",
      "with a tethered kinase domain and the other with a tethered adapter protein. \n",
      "Specifically, we expressed EGFR-ERBB4, EGFR-SHC1, ERBB2-GRB7 and ERBB2-SHC1, in \n",
      "cancer cell lines and demonstrated that they are oncogenic, regulate downstream \n",
      "signaling and are sensitive to small molecule inhibition with EGFR and HER2 \n",
      "TKIs.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We found that ERBB fusions are recurrent mutations that occur \n",
      "across multiple cancer types. We also establish that adapter-tethered and \n",
      "kinase-tethered fusions are oncogenic and can be inhibited with EGFR or HER2 \n",
      "inhibitors. We further propose a nomenclature system to categorize these fusions \n",
      "into several functional classes.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: The recently updated World Health Organization classification of \n",
      "central nervous system (CNS) tumors, 5th edition, (CNS5) reclassifies pediatric \n",
      "tumors according to their distinct molecular drivers, recognizing a new \n",
      "entity-infant-type hemispheric glioma (IHG). Defined by its unique epigenetic \n",
      "signature, and/or genomic fusions in ALK, ROS1, NTRK, or MET gene, IHG subsumes \n",
      "many cases previously classified as congenital glioblastoma (cGBM). Histologic \n",
      "features of IHG are still poorly defined with known overlap with a clinic \n",
      "radiologically similar entity-desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma/astrocytoma \n",
      "(DIG).\n",
      "METHODS: We revisited our cohort of cGBMs and DIGs, now reclassifying them \n",
      "according to CNS5 and compared the clinical, radiologic, molecular and \n",
      "histologic features between the two.\n",
      "RESULTS: 3/6 cases of cGBM that underwent targeted NGS fusion mutation panel \n",
      "were positive for ALK fusions (involving MAP4, MZT2Bex2, and EML4 genes as \n",
      "fusion partners), and 1/6 showed GOPC:ROS1 fusion. Interestingly, GOPC:ROS1 \n",
      "fusion was also shared by 1/5 cases of histologically defined DIG. DNA \n",

      "DIG cases as IHG (including the case with ROS1 alteration).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: In conclusion, histology alone is insufficient to distinguish IHG \n",

      "BACKGROUND: Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor. Clear classification \n",
      "is crucial for accurate diagnosis and individualized treatment. \n",
      "Histopathological characteristics and genetic alterations have shown to be \n",
      "related to prognosis and treatment response. Germline variants are important \n",
      "components of genetic alterations. However, the distribution of germline \n",
      "variations in glioma patients and their association with survival remain \n",
      "unknown.\n",
      "METHODS: We carried out whole-exome sequencing on 99 cases to explore germline \n",
      "variants in glioma. We also analyzed the association of germline variants with \n",
      "clinicopathological features and other prognostic indicators.\n",
      "RESULTS: All the glioma cases harbored rare germline variants. Germline ALK \n",
      "variants (gALK-Mut) were identified in 12/99 (12.12%) patients. The gALK-Mut \n",

      "have a more favorable clinical outcome, suggesting biological differences \n",
